# Architecture and technical solutions

This document is a "living" document that is constantly updated. In its current form, it is only a rough framework that "can" be used as a basis for technical documentation of projects. The structure can and must be modified! The goal is to create a document that seamlessly integrates the design documentation with the rest of the project documentation. The author assumes no responsibility for the content of this document.
