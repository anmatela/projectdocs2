The end report should primarily answer the following questions: what and how was done, why it was done, what was successful, what failed and why, how problems were solved and what was learned.
Start the introduction by briefly explaining which project is this document about, who were involved (project organization) and what is the meaning and content of this document.

# 2 ASSIGNMENT, TARGET AND RESULTS
 
## 2.1 Overview of the project
Outcome of the project based on the project objectives and assignments:

* was it successful


 
## 2.2 Success of the project (plan versus result)
The project process should be introduced by describing at least the following items:
* structure of the process: stages and tasks, principles of the implementation and schedule
* internal time resources: planned and realized resources by stage and weekly, distribution between project management and actual content tasks
* external resources: consultations, training, reviews, testing etc
